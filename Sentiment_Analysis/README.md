# Sentiment Analysis using Hugging Face Transformers

This project performs sentiment analysis on airline tweets using Hugging Face's pre-trained transformer pipeline. The workflow includes data preprocessing, visualization, classification using the transformers library, and evaluation using various metrics.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Task: Sentiment classification (positive/negative)

Model: Pre-trained pipeline from Hugging Face (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)

Dataset: Airline Tweets dataset

Libraries Used: transformers, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, torch

## 📁 File Structure
sentiment_analysis_hugging_face.py: Main Python script (converted from Colab) containing all steps for sentiment analysis.

Tweets.csv: Input dataset file (not included, needs to be placed in the working directory).

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Make sure you have all the required libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn transformers torch
Add the Tweets.csv file in the same directory.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sentiment_analysis_hugging_face.py
## 📊 Features
Pre-trained Model: Uses Hugging Face’s pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

Binary Classification: Filters out neutral sentiments for binary classification

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

ROC-AUC Score

## 📈 Sample Outputs
Sentiment prediction for sample sentences

Distribution plot of sentiment labels

Confusion matrix heatmap

ROC-AUC score display

## ✅ Results
Achieved a reasonable accuracy and ROC-AUC score by applying a simple, pre-trained sentiment analysis pipeline directly on real-world tweets.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
Fine-tune the model on the airline dataset.

Use more advanced preprocessing techniques (tokenization, cleaning).

Expand classification to include neutral sentiment as a separate class.
